# Cheesecake Landing Page Project

This a project for the landing page of Cheesecake Labs website.



## Quick start

This project contains experimental WebGL features, so make sure you test it in a modern browser such as Google Chrome to establish the intended viewing experience.

If you are viewing this from a mobile device and you don't see particles but instead a blue background on the top header, that means your device does not support WebGL, you will probably get an error message at the footer.

You should run this app on a localhost/web server environment so you won't get cross domain issues. If you have any trouble running the app you can checkout the [live demo](http://www.danieldarvile.com.br/cheesecake/index.html).

Please see the instruction below to set up the environment.

Follow this simple guide:

Make sure you have npm and node installed on your system.
Install sass globally 
```shell
gem install sass
```

Install Grunt

```shell
npm install grunt -g
```

Install dependencies

```shell
npm install 
```
Run

```shell
grunt
```

Cheers! :)
